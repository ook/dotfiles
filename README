Keep in mind that the $HOME/.config directory is heavily use by XDG compliant application 
(that's a very good thing!) so to use my files under config/, I recommand to symlink them 
individualy (something like find config -exec ln -s {} ~/.config/ \;).

Since vim is a big part, I store it in another git project (available here: 
http://github.com/ook/vimconfig)
